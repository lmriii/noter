# Noter
### No(te) (record)er

I take many notes. In meetings, when reading books, conversations, etc. After doing this for so long I find that I have a collection of knowledge/experiences that can be made a bit more accessible.

Here I'm using React/Typescript to do the frontend of the app and Node/Express/MongoDB for the backend.
